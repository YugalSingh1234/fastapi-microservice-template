# Architecture Decision Record: API Versioning Strategy

## ADR-0003: Implementing URI Path Versioning for API

### Status

Accepted

### Context

As our FastAPI Microservice evolves, we need a strategy to introduce changes to our API without breaking existing client integrations. A well-defined API versioning strategy allows us to iterate on our API while maintaining backward compatibility.

Key considerations:
1. Ease of use for API consumers
2. Simplicity of implementation and maintenance
3. Ability to support multiple versions concurrently
4. Clear communication of API changes
5. Impact on API discoverability and documentation

### Decision

We have decided to implement URI Path Versioning for our API.

### Rationale

1. **Simplicity**: URI path versioning is straightforward to implement and understand. Clients can easily specify which version of the API they want to use.

2. **Visibility**: The version is clearly visible in the URI, making it easy for developers to identify which version they're working with.

3. **Routing**: FastAPI makes it simple to implement URI path versioning using its routing system.

4. **Documentation**: Tools like Swagger UI can easily display different versions of the API.

5. **Caching**: URI-based versioning works well with HTTP caching mechanisms.

6. **Flexibility**: We can easily support multiple versions of the API concurrently.

### Implementation Details

1. We will prefix all API routes with a version number: `/api/v1/...`, `/api/v2/...`, etc.

2. The initial version will be v1.

3. When introducing breaking changes, we will create a new API version (e.g., v2) while maintaining the old version for a deprecation period.

4. Example implementation in FastAPI:

   ```python
   from fastapi import APIRouter, FastAPI

   app = FastAPI()

   v1_router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/v1")
   v2_router = APIRouter(prefix="/api/v2")

   @v1_router.get("/users")
   async def get_users_v1():
       # v1 implementation

   @v2_router.get("/users")
   async def get_users_v2():
       # v2 implementation

   app.include_router(v1_router)
   app.include_router(v2_router)
   ```

5. We will maintain separate API documentation for each version.

6. We will communicate deprecation timelines clearly to API consumers.

### Consequences

Positive:
- Clear and visible versioning for API consumers.
- Easy to implement and maintain in FastAPI.
- Allows supporting multiple API versions concurrently.
- Works well with API documentation tools.

Negative:
- URL length increases with version prefix.
- Requires discipline to maintain backward compatibility within a version.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Header Versioning**: Rejected due to reduced visibility and potential issues with caching.
2. **Query Parameter Versioning**: Considered but rejected due to potential conflicts with resource query parameters.
3. **Content Negotiation**: More complex to implement and less visible to API consumers.

### Review

We will review this decision annually or when we introduce a new major version of the API, whichever comes first. We'll evaluate:

1. Any difficulties encountered in maintaining multiple API versions.
2. Feedback from API consumers on the versioning strategy.
3. The impact on API discoverability and documentation.
4. Whether the strategy has successfully prevented breaking changes for clients.
