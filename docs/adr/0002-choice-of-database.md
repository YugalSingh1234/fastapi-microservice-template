# Architecture Decision Record: Choice of Database

## ADR-0002: Selecting PostgreSQL as the Primary Database

### Status

Accepted

### Context

Our FastAPI Microservice requires a robust, scalable, and feature-rich database solution. We need to choose a database that can handle our current needs and scale with the application as it grows. The database should support complex queries, transactions, and have good ecosystem support.

Key considerations:
1. Scalability and performance
2. Data integrity and ACID compliance
3. Support for complex queries and JSON data
4. Ecosystem and tool support
5. Team's familiarity and expertise
6. Hosting and operational costs

### Decision

We have decided to use PostgreSQL as the primary database for our FastAPI Microservice.

### Rationale

1. **Scalability and Performance**: PostgreSQL is known for its ability to handle large amounts of data and complex queries efficiently. It supports both vertical and horizontal scaling options.

2. **ACID Compliance**: PostgreSQL provides full ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, ensuring data integrity in all operations.

3. **Feature-rich**: PostgreSQL supports advanced features like JSON data types, full-text search, and complex queries, which align well with our potential future needs.

4. **Ecosystem and Tool Support**: There's a vast ecosystem around PostgreSQL, including ORMs (e.g., SQLAlchemy), migration tools (e.g., Alembic), and monitoring solutions.

5. **Team Expertise**: Our team has significant experience with PostgreSQL, which will accelerate development and troubleshooting.

6. **Cost-effective**: As an open-source solution, PostgreSQL can be more cost-effective compared to proprietary databases, especially at scale.

7. **Cloud Support**: Major cloud providers offer managed PostgreSQL services, facilitating easier deployment and maintenance.

### Consequences

Positive:
- Robust and reliable database solution with a proven track record.
- Excellent performance for both simple and complex queries.
- Rich feature set that can accommodate future requirements.
- Strong community support and regular updates.

Negative:
- May require more initial setup and tuning compared to some NoSQL alternatives.
- Horizontal scaling, while possible, can be more complex than with some distributed NoSQL databases.

### Implementation

1. We will use SQLAlchemy as our ORM to interact with PostgreSQL.
2. Alembic will be used for database migrations.
3. Initial schema design will focus on normalizing data where appropriate, utilizing PostgreSQL's strengths.
4. We'll implement connection pooling to optimize database connections.

### Alternatives Considered

1. MongoDB: Offered simplicity and flexibility but lacked strong ACID compliance and had limitations for complex queries.
2. MySQL: A strong alternative, but PostgreSQL edge out in terms of feature set and our team's expertise.
3. Amazon DynamoDB: Considered for its scalability, but its limited query capabilities and potential vendor lock-in were concerns.

### Review

This decision will be reviewed in 6 months or when we reach 1 million active users, whichever comes first. We'll evaluate our database performance, any scaling issues encountered, and whether our needs have evolved beyond what PostgreSQL can offer efficiently.
