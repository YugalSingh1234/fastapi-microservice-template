# Architecture Decision Record: Use of CQRS Pattern

## ADR-0001: Implementing CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

### Status

Accepted

### Context

As our application grows in complexity, we're facing challenges with the current architecture:

1. Increased load on the database, especially for read operations.
2. Complex domain models that are difficult to optimize for both read and write operations.
3. Performance issues when scaling the application.
4. Difficulty in implementing certain business requirements due to the current unified model.

### Decision

We have decided to implement the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern for specific high-traffic or complex domains within our application.

CQRS suggests separating the command side (write operations) from the query side (read operations). This separation allows us to optimize each side independently and scale them according to their specific needs.

### Consequences

Positive:
1. Improved scalability: We can scale read and write operations independently.
2. Better performance: Optimized read models can significantly improve query performance.
3. Flexibility in data storage: We can use different data stores optimized for reads or writes.
4. Simplified domain models: Separating concerns makes individual models simpler and more focused.

Negative:
1. Increased complexity: CQRS adds complexity to the system architecture.
2. Eventual consistency: The read side might not always be immediately up-to-date with the write side.
3. Learning curve: Team members will need to understand and adapt to the CQRS pattern.
4. Potential for over-engineering: Not all parts of the system may benefit from CQRS.

### Implementation Details

1. We will start by implementing CQRS for the `Order` domain, as it has high read and write loads with complex business logic.

2. Command (Write) Side:
   - Use the existing PostgreSQL database.
   - Implement command handlers to process write operations.
   - Emit domain events for each state change.

3. Query (Read) Side:
   - Implement a separate read database (initially PostgreSQL, with the option to switch to a NoSQL solution later if needed).
   - Create denormalized read models optimized for specific query use cases.
   - Implement event handlers to update read models based on domain events.

4. We will use Apache Kafka as the event bus to propagate events between the command and query sides.

5. Implement eventual consistency between write and read models, with mechanisms to handle stale data scenarios in the UI.

### Metrics for Success

1. Query performance improvement (target: 50% reduction in average response time for complex queries).
2. Improved scalability (target: ability to handle 3x current peak load without degradation).
3. Reduction in database load (target: 40% reduction in database CPU utilization).
4. Developer productivity (qualitative assessment of ease of implementing new features).

### Review Date

We will review the effectiveness of this decision and the metrics in 6 months (January 15, 2025).
