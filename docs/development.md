## Introduction

This guide provides instructions and best practices for developing the FastAPI Microservice. It is intended for developers who will be working on extending or maintaining the microservice.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/onlythompon/fastapi-microservice.git
   cd fastapi-microservice
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Update the values in `.env` with your local configuration

5. Start the development server:
   ```
   uvicorn src.presentation.main:app --reload
   ```

## Project Structure

Our project follows a Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design principles. Here's an overview of the main directories:

- `src/domain/`: Contains domain entities, value objects, and business logic
- `src/application/`: Application services and use cases
- `src/infrastructure/`: External concerns like databases, caching, and messaging
- `src/presentation/`: API routes, request/response models
- `src/core/`: Cross-cutting concerns like config, logging, and security
- `tests/`: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests

## Coding Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Use type hints throughout the codebase
- Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

We use the following tools to enforce coding standards:

- Black for code formatting
- isort for import sorting
- flake8 for linting
- mypy for static type checking

Run these tools before committing:

```
black .
isort .
flake8
mypy .
```

## Testing

We use pytest for all levels of testing. To run tests:

```
pytest
```

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Use integration tests for database operations and external service interactions
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows

## Database Migrations

We use Alembic for database migrations. To create a new migration:

```
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
```

To apply migrations:

```
alembic upgrade head
```

## API Documentation

We use FastAPI's built-in Swagger UI for API documentation. Access it at `/docs` when running the server.

Keep the API documentation up-to-date by properly annotating your FastAPI route functions with descriptions and response models.

## Logging

Use the logging module for all logging. Import it in your modules like this:

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

Log important events, errors, and debugging information as appropriate.

## Error Handling

- Use custom exception classes defined in `src/core/exceptions.py`
- Handle exceptions at the appropriate level, typically in the presentation layer
- Return consistent error responses using the error handling middleware

## Security Best Practices

- Never store sensitive information (like API keys or passwords) in the code
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper authentication and authorization for all endpoints
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use HTTPS in production

## Performance Considerations

- Use async functions for I/O-bound operations
- Implement caching for frequently accessed, rarely changing data
- Use database indexing appropriately
- Profile your code to identify and optimize bottlenecks

## Contributing Guidelines

1. Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix
2. Write tests for your changes
3. Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request
4. Update documentation as necessary
5. Follow the code review process
