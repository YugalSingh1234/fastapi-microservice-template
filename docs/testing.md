## Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy for our FastAPI Microservice. It provides guidelines for different types of tests, test coverage expectations, and best practices to ensure the reliability and quality of our codebase.

## Testing Pyramid

We follow the Testing Pyramid approach, which suggests having:

- Many low-level unit tests
- Fewer integration tests
- Even fewer end-to-end tests

This approach helps us balance thoroughness, speed, and maintenance costs.

## Types of Tests

### Unit Tests

- **Purpose**: Test individual components in isolation.
- **Location**: `tests/unit/`
- **Framework**: pytest
- **Coverage Expectation**: Aim for 80% code coverage with unit tests.

Example unit test:

```python
# tests/unit/test_user_service.py
import pytest
from src.application.services.user_service import UserService
from src.domain.entities.user import User

def test_create_user():
    user_service = UserService()
    user = user_service.create_user("test@example.com", "password123")
    assert isinstance(user, User)
    assert user.email == "test@example.com"
```

### Integration Tests

- **Purpose**: Test interaction between components and external services (e.g., database, cache).
- **Location**: `tests/integration/`
- **Framework**: pytest
- **Coverage Expectation**: Cover all critical paths and edge cases.

Example integration test:

```python
# tests/integration/test_user_repository.py
import pytest
from src.infrastructure.database.connection import get_db
from src.infrastructure.repositories.user_repository import UserRepository

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_create_and_retrieve_user():
    async with get_db() as db:
        repo = UserRepository(db)
        user = await repo.create_user("test@example.com", "password123")
        retrieved_user = await repo.get_user_by_email("test@example.com")
        assert retrieved_user.id == user.id
        assert retrieved_user.email == "test@example.com"
```

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

- **Purpose**: Test the entire system as a whole, simulating real user scenarios.
- **Location**: `tests/e2e/`
- **Framework**: pytest with FastAPI TestClient
- **Coverage Expectation**: Cover all critical user flows.

Example E2E test:

```python
# tests/e2e/test_user_registration.py
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from src.presentation.main import app

client = TestClient(app)

def test_user_registration_flow():
    response = client.post(
        "/api/v1/users/register",
        json={"email": "newuser@example.com", "password": "securepass123"}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 201
    assert "id" in response.json()

    login_response = client.post(
        "/api/v1/auth/login",
        data={"username": "newuser@example.com", "password": "securepass123"}
    )
    assert login_response.status_code == 200
    assert "access_token" in login_response.json()
```

### Performance Tests

- **Purpose**: Ensure the system performs well under expected load.
- **Tool**: Locust
- **Location**: `tests/performance/`
- **Frequency**: Run before each major release and after significant changes.

Example Locust test:

```python
# tests/performance/locustfile.py
from locust import HttpUser, task, between

class WebsiteUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 5)

    @task
    def get_users(self):
        self.client.get("/api/v1/users")

    @task
    def create_user(self):
        self.client.post("/api/v1/users", json={
            "email": "test@example.com",
            "password": "password123"
        })
```

## Test Environment

- Maintain separate environments for development, testing, and production.
- Use Docker to ensure consistency across environments.
- Use environment variables for configuration to easily switch between environments.

## Test Data Management

- Use factories (e.g., Factory Boy) to generate test data.
- Implement database seeding for integration and E2E tests.
- Reset the database state before each test run to ensure test isolation.

## Mocking and Stubbing

- Use `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` for mocking in unit tests.
- Create stub implementations for external services in integration tests when necessary.

## Code Coverage

- Use coverage.py to measure code coverage.
- Aim for at least 80% overall code coverage.
- Generate coverage reports as part of the CI pipeline.

## Continuous Integration

- Run all tests on every pull request.
- Configure CI to run unit and integration tests on every commit.
- Run E2E and performance tests nightly or before releases.

## Test Automation

- Automate test execution as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- Use pre-commit hooks to run linters and unit tests before allowing commits.

## Security Testing

- Integrate security scanning tools (e.g., Bandit) into the CI pipeline.
- Perform regular vulnerability assessments.
- Conduct penetration testing before major releases.

## Accessibility Testing

- Use automated accessibility testing tools (e.g., axe-core) for frontend components.
- Conduct manual accessibility audits periodically.

## Best Practices

1. Write tests before or alongside feature code (TDD/BDD).
2. Keep tests simple, focused, and easy to understand.
3. Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior.
4. Avoid test interdependencies; each test should be able to run in isolation.
5. Regularly refactor tests to maintain clarity and efficiency.
6. Use parameterized tests to cover multiple scenarios efficiently.

## Tools and Frameworks

- Test Runner: pytest
- Mocking: unittest.mock, pytest-mock
- Code Coverage: coverage.py
- Performance Testing: Locust
- Security Scanning: Bandit
- Linting: flake8, mypy
- Formatting: Black, isort

## Reporting and Documentation

- Generate test reports after each test run in CI.
- Maintain up-to-date testing documentation, including this strategy document.
- Review and update the testing strategy regularly to adapt to project needs.

By following this testing strategy, we aim to maintain high code quality, prevent regressions, and ensure the reliability and performance of our FastAPI Microservice.
