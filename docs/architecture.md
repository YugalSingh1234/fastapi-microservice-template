# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level architecture of our FastAPI Microservice. The architecture follows Clean Architecture principles and incorporates elements of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to ensure a scalable, maintainable, and loosely coupled system.

## Architectural Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns:** The application is divided into distinct layers, each with a specific responsibility.
2. **Dependency Rule:** Dependencies point inwards. Inner layers are unaware of outer layers.
3. **Abstraction:** Use of interfaces and abstract classes to define boundaries between layers.
4. **Testability:** The architecture facilitates easy testing of business logic independent of external concerns.

## Project Structure

Our project follows this structure:

## Layers

### 1. Domain Layer (`src/domain/`)

- **Responsibility:** Contains enterprise-wide business rules and entities.
- **Key Components:**
  - `entities/`: Core business entities
  - `value_objects/`: Immutable objects that are distinguishable only by their properties
  - `events/`: Domain events for important state changes
  - `exceptions.py`: Domain-specific exceptions

### 2. Application Layer (`src/application/`)

- **Responsibility:** Contains application-specific business rules and orchestrates the flow of data.
- **Key Components:**
  - `interfaces/`: Abstractions for repositories and services
  - `services/`: Application services implementing business logic
  - `use_cases/`: Use case implementations

### 3. Infrastructure Layer (`src/infrastructure/`)

- **Responsibility:** Contains implementations of interfaces defined in the application layer and all external concerns.
- **Key Components:**
  - `database/`: Database connection and configuration
  - `repositories/`: Implementations of repository interfaces
  - `messaging/`: Messaging implementations (e.g., Kafka)
  - `cache/`: Caching implementations (e.g., Redis)

### 4. Presentation Layer (`src/presentation/`)

- **Responsibility:** Handles external requests and responses.
- **Key Components:**
  - `api/`: FastAPI route definitions and request/response models
  - `grpc/`: gRPC service implementations (if applicable)
  - `graphql/`: GraphQL schema and resolvers (if applicable)

### 5. Core (`src/core/`)

- **Responsibility:** Contains cross-cutting concerns and shared utilities.
- **Key Components:**
  - `config.py`: Configuration management
  - `exceptions.py`: Global exception handling
  - `logging.py`: Logging configuration
  - `events.py`: Event handling
  - `security.py`: Security utilities
  - `middlewares.py`: Request/response processing middlewares
  - `telemetry.py`: Distributed tracing and monitoring
  - `health.py`: Health check endpoints

### 6. Common (`src/common/`)

- **Responsibility:** Shared utilities and constants used across the application.
- **Key Components:**
  - `constants.py`: Application-wide constants
  - `utils.py`: Shared utility functions

## Key Design Patterns and Concepts

1. **Repository Pattern:** Used in `src/infrastructure/repositories/` to abstract data persistence operations.
2. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Implemented in the application layer to separate read and write operations for complex domains.
3. **Event Sourcing:** Utilized in `src/domain/events/` for domains requiring a complete history of changes.
4. **Dependency Injection:** Used throughout the application, facilitated by FastAPI's dependency injection system.

## External Dependencies

1. **Database:** PostgreSQL for persistent storage, configured in `src/infrastructure/database/`.
2. **Caching:** Redis for distributed caching and locking, implemented in `src/infrastructure/cache/`.
3. **Messaging:** Apache Kafka for asynchronous communication, set up in `src/infrastructure/messaging/`.
4. **API Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI, automatically generated by FastAPI.

## Deployment Architecture

The microservice is designed to be deployed in a containerized environment, preferably on a Kubernetes cluster. Key components include:

1. **Dockerfile:** Located in the root directory for building the application container.
2. **docker-compose.yml:** In the root directory for local development and testing.
3. **Kubernetes Manifests:** Located in the `k8s/` directory, including:
   - `deployment.yaml`: For deploying the application
   - `service.yaml`: For internal networking
   - `ingress.yaml`: For external access

## Testing

The `tests/` directory is structured to support different types of tests:

- `unit/`: For testing individual components in isolation
- `integration/`: For testing interactions between components
- `e2e/`: For end-to-end testing of the entire system

## Security Considerations

Security measures are primarily implemented in `src/core/security.py` and include:

1. JWT-based authentication for API endpoints
2. Role-based access control (RBAC)
3. Integration with external secrets management (e.g., HashiCorp Vault)

## Performance Optimizations

1. Caching strategy using Redis, implemented in `src/infrastructure/cache/`
2. Database optimizations configured in `src/infrastructure/database/`
3. Asynchronous processing using background tasks and message queues

## Scalability

The architecture supports horizontal scalability through:

1. Stateless application design
2. Use of distributed caching (Redis)
3. Message-based communication (Kafka) for asynchronous processing
4. Database read replicas for scaling read operations

## Documentation

The `docs/` directory contains:

1. `api.md`: Detailed API documentation
2. `architecture.md`: This architecture overview
3. `adr/`: Architecture Decision Records for significant design decisions

## Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains utility scripts for various tasks such as:

- `secret_rotation.sh`: For rotating secrets
- Other maintenance and deployment scripts

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building scalable, maintainable, and performant microservices using FastAPI. It's designed to be flexible and can evolve as the project requirements grow and change over time.
